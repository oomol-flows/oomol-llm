# LLM - AI Language Model Blocks for OOMOL

A collection of ready-to-use AI language model building blocks for the OOMOL platform, designed to help you create intelligent conversational workflows without writing code.

## What is This Project?

This project provides pre-built **blocks** (reusable components) that allow you to integrate AI language models into your OOMOL workflows. Think of blocks as LEGO pieces - you can connect them together to build powerful AI applications like chatbots, translators, content generators, and more.
